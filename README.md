Here are the Cloud Computing Service Types with real-world examples:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Definition:
IaaS provides basic computing infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, networks, and servers over the internet.

Real-world examples:

Amazon EC2 – renting virtual servers to host websites

Google Compute Engine – running applications on virtual machines

Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines – creating and managing online servers

Real-life use:
A company hosts its website on rented cloud servers instead of buying physical servers.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Definition:
PaaS provides a ready-made platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications without worrying about hardware or system setup.

Real-world examples:

Google App Engine – developing and deploying web apps

Heroku – hosting applications with minimal setup

Microsoft Azure App Service – building and running web/mobile apps

Real-life use:
Developers create a web application without managing servers or operating systems.

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

Definition:
SaaS provides fully functional software applications over the internet that users can access through a web browser.

Real-world examples:

Gmail – email service

Google Drive – cloud storage and file sharing

2.	If you are planning to start a cloud service what type of service would you provide? Why?
```

I would choose Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where software applications are provided over the internet and can be used through a web browser, without installing or maintaining the software on a local computer.


High user demand
Many users prefer ready-to-use applications such as email, storage, learning platforms, and business tools without installing software.

Easy access for users
SaaS applications can be accessed through a web browser from anywhere, which makes them ideal for students, businesses, and organizations.

Lower cost for customers
Users do not need to buy hardware or software licenses. They can use the service with a subscription or free model.

Scalability
SaaS can easily scale to serve more users by using cloud infrastructure as the user base grows.

Simpler for users to manage
The service provider handles updates, security, and maintenance, so users don’t need technical expertise.
